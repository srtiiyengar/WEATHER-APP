# WEATHER-APP
Built a weather app using AccuWeather API

Technical Environment: HTML5, CSS, BOOTSTRAP,  JAVASCRIPT, ACCUWEATHER API
Description: This application gives you the weather condition of the specified location. In this app I have used location API to fetch the user location and passing this location key to other APIs  like forecast API to get information of specific location and Current condition API to get current  weather condition of specific location.
